# Proforce_back

##Welcome to Proforce App Project / Backend

###What is this about ?
Proforce is the app that emerged to automate a tedious and error prone task of complining quality documentation in Industrial Projects.
The main concept is to get a template based engine that allows for easy maniuplation of externally fed documents (often in form of a PDF) and provide an uniform way to quickly quality doc compilations that are often very large and cumbersone when handled manually.

###What is the state of the app ?
Currently, the Proforce app is in it's very early stages. It will be developed further as a hobby.

###How to run it ?
In order to run the bakend layer, copy the repo and run the gradle wrapper. You will need to modify "application.properties" with your database logon data. If you using anything else than Postgresql, you will also need to modify the build.gradle file accordingly.
The back end is currently running on Heroku, under the following adress: http://proforce.herokuapp.com

###Where is the front ?
The front can be found in the other proforce repository, under the following adress:
